To add movies into ur database u can put this code inside the AdminController.cs
    
    
    
    public void AddMovies(List<(string title, int year, string description, string authors, string categories, string directors, int age, int durationInMin)> movies)
    {
        using (var db = new DataBaseConnection())
        {
            foreach (var movieInfo in movies)
            {
                var newMovie = new Film
                {
                    Title = movieInfo.title,
                    Year = movieInfo.year,
                    Description = movieInfo.description,
                    Authors = movieInfo.authors,
                    Categories = movieInfo.categories,
                    Directors = movieInfo.directors,
                    Age = movieInfo.age,
                    DurationInMin = movieInfo.durationInMin
                };

                db.Movie.Add(newMovie);
            }
